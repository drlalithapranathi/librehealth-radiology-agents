"""#52: the comms ledger against a LIVE FHIR server. The one part of CritCom mocks cannot verify.

test_comms_ledger.py mocks the transport, so it asserts what we SEND. It passes even when the
server rejects every write -- which is exactly what happened: HAPI enforces referential integrity,
and the ledger deliberately holds references to resources that live in fhir2 and are absent here
(Communication.subject / Task.for -> Patient/*, basedOn / about -> ServiceRequest/*). Every write
came back HTTP 400 (HAPI-1094), and with integrity merely disabled the references were not INDEXED,
so the audit searches returned 0 rows -- an audit trail that silently does not exist. The compose
fix is `hapi.fhir.auto_create_placeholder_reference_targets`; these tests are what stop it
regressing, in the compose config, the search params, or the reference shapes.

The assertions deliberately overlap the mocked suite, because the failures they catch are all
server-side -- a 400 on write, or a search that silently returns nothing -- and a mock can express
neither. Verified by re-introducing the bug: with the placeholder setting off, five of these fail.

Runs only against a live ledger (the `comms-ledger-it` CI job, or locally):

    docker compose up -d comms-ledger
    cd libs/radagent-common
    COMMS_LEDGER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8108/fhir python -m pytest tests/test_comms_ledger_it.py

Async is driven with asyncio.run, matching test_comms_ledger.py: the lib's test lanes install
pytest WITHOUT pytest-asyncio, so a coroutine test would not run there.
